                     License Agreement for Super Jukebox Source Code

I am making the source code for Super Jukebox publicly avaialable mainly for educational
purposes. Learn as much as you can from it and even use parts of it in your own programs,
you can even modify the program itself as much as you want, but here's the catch, if you do 
modify it you must *NOT* distribute the modified version in any way, shape or form, in short
you must keep it for yourself. That's basically all. But remember, I take no responsibility
for anything. C-ya!
